## Dependencies

This project definitely wouldn't have been quite so possible without the making use of the following package and components. Full credit and big kudos to their respective authors, who've done an amazing job in building and maintaining them. For a full breakdown of dependency licenses, please see [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS](<TOOL REPO>/blob/<PRIMARY BRANCH>/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md)

The application linting is done with [**ESLint**](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/), both following the [**AirBnB Styleguide**](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Some configs are defined in [**YAML**](https://github.com/yaml/yaml), with a simple [**Node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs/node) server to serve up the static app and the optional API endpoints, and container deployment and testing is done with [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/).


### External Services

 Code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) and Docker images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
