        When making changes to the documentation, be sure to double check that:
        - Link and images URLs properly resolve
        - Your spelling and grammar is correct
        - Any markdown formatting is valid 

    - id: dependency-changes
      files:
      - yarn.lock
      body: >
        When updating dependencies, take a moment to verify that there are not security
        issues associated with any added or modified packages. If adding a new dependency,
        ensure that it is totally necessary, and check the packages size is not too large,
        as this will increase overall bundle size.

      files: [ '.env', '*.env', '.env*' ]
      body: >
        You're making changes to the main server entry point. Please test the app thoroughly,

      files:
      - .gitignore
      body: >
        When modifying the .gitignore, please do not remove any of the existing paths,
        as this may cause files and directories to be unintentionally committed to git

    - id: ignored-dependencies
      files:
      - node_modules/**/*
      body: >
        Please do not commit dependencies to git. Node modules will be pulled down
        when yarn is run, prior to building the app
    
    - id: code-owners
      files:
      - .github/CODEOWNERS
      body: >

        as possible, and only assign yourself to files that you created and wish to help
        maintain (such as a language file, specific feature or widget).
