- **Clone** the fork locally
- Make the **changes and additions** desired to the cloned fork
- **Modify** the [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] file, following its structure.
- **Modify** [CITATION.cff][citation] file, updating their **version number** using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## Adding a translation [[↑][index]]

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project!
Usually, the process of making a translation is quite **similar** to any other contribution, so follow the steps explained [here][new-features-hook].
The main **difference** are the steps in the [./CONTRIBUTING.md][lang-contributing] file which explains how to tamper with the translation files and **add** a new **translation**.

## Other contributions [[↑][index]]

You can even contribute by adding new enhancement and improvement **ideas** to the [ideas discussion][ideas-discussion] or lending someone a hand in the repository!
